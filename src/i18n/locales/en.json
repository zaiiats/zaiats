Throughout the 7 rounds, users discuss their strengths, evaluate others and vote. Those who manage to prove their usefulness to the group — and remain in the game — become the winners.</p>"

      "description": "<h3>Role and access system</h3><p>The project implements a flexible access system with four levels: Guest, Client, Employee and Admin. Each user only sees the pages and features that correspond to their role. All routes are fully protected: guests are automatically redirected to the login page, and all authenticated users are taken to their own dashboard. This ensures security and a correct distribution of permissions within the system.</p><h3>Routing and session handling</h3><p>Routes are stored in the URL, while tokens and user data are kept in browser storage. Thanks to this, a user can refresh the page or return to work without logging in again. All transitions are validated before rendering, so access to unauthorized pages is impossible.</p><h3>Caching and data fetching</h3><p>The system uses React Query for data management. Thanks to this, tables, contract lists, profiles and other data are automatically updated right after changes. Cache invalidation, stale time, refetch on focus and automatic retries on errors are implemented. This makes the interface highly responsive and stable.</p><h3>Authentication and account creation</h3><p>During registration or when an admin creates an account, the system checks the uniqueness of the phone number, email, login and passport number. After the account is created, the user receives an email with their login credentials. Tokens are bound to cache keys to prevent old data from being shown, even if another employee previously worked in the same session.</p><h3>Products and price calculator</h3><p>Guests can browse the product catalog and use search without creating an account. For client convenience, a price calculator is implemented that automatically calculates the cost of a potential contract based on the selected product and parameters.</p><h3>Dashboards and statistics</h3><p>Clients and guests see a main page with summary statistics. Employees and admins have access to an extended dashboard where detailed information about contracts, clients, teams and requests is displayed.</p><h3>Contracts and team workflow</h3><p>Clients can create contracts, enter their data and confirm them with payment. Teams work with contracts in several stages: a team lead picks a contract, its status changes to pending, and then the client can submit payout requests. Employees process these requests and approve payouts that do not exceed the initial contract limit. After the collaboration, the client can rate the team, which forms their overall rating.</p><h3>Team management</h3><p>The system includes teams with team leads and members. A single employee cannot be part of multiple teams at once and cannot be a team lead twice. The admin manages teams, creates new ones and deletes empty teams.</p><h3>User profile</h3><p>Each client can update their profile, add or remove an avatar (files are stored in Supabase buckets), change their password or other personal data via dedicated modal windows.</p><h3>Automation and background jobs</h3><p>The system has fully automated background processes. A database backup is created weekly, and the last ten copies are stored on the server. A daily cron job checks contract statuses and whether teams meet response deadlines. New contracts automatically appear for employees and admins with a modal notification.</p><h3>Infrastructure</h3><p>The frontend is hosted on Netlify over HTTPS, the backend runs on Contabo, and the Supabase database ensures stability, security, file storage and PostgreSQL-based data handling. All parts of the system work together reliably and securely.</p>"
